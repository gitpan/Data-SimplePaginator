Data::SimplePaginator is for making fixed length "pages" of any set of data
and accessing them in a simple way.  I created it after trying other
pagination modules on CPAN and not feeling comfortable with the defaults,
or the interface, or the implementation. 

Data::SimplePaginator is short and to the point.
